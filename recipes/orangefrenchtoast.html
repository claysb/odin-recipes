            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>4 large eggs</li>
                    <li>½ cup milk</li>
                    <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
                    <li>¼ cup Triple Sec or other orange liqueur</li>
                    <li>½ fresh orange, zested and juiced</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon orange extract</li>
                    <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
                    <li>⅛ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
                    <li>12 slices cinnamon raisin bread</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon confectioners sugar, or as needed (optional)</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons warm maple syrup, or as needed</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease two large baking sheets or line with parchment paper, lightly sprayed with cooking spray, which will keep the bread from sticking.</li>
                    <li>In a bowl, whisk eggs until light in color. Add milk, sugar, orange liqueur, orange juice, orange zest, orange extract, salt, and nutmeg, whisking until well combined.</li>
                    <li>Coat bread slices in the egg custard, and place on the baking sheets without overlapping. Bake until golden brown, flipping halfway through baking time, about 15 minutes.</li>
                    <li>To serve, sprinkle with confectioners sugar and drizzle with maple syrup.</li>
                </ol>
